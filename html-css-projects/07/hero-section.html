      <!-- <nav class="navigation"> -->
      <nav class="main-nav">
        <!-- * Usually we add a bunch of anchor element inside <nav> element but it's not best semantic way because navigation should be a list of links grouped together
          * what we do here is create unordered list and inside that list we will add all the links: main-nav-list and it's many developers used -->

      * now what it does not include is content that is repeated across multiple pages like <header>, <footer>, sidebar, <aside> related info...
      * so if we have multiple page we can use in the same header, footer, sidebar, aside... or other content which not change so these parts are not a part of the <main> element 
      ! and we even might not styling <main> element, just for readers and search engine know that well this is exactly this is the main part of our page -->
    <main>
      <!-- ! We should named section class is: section-name because we have many section with the part of the page right, not like <article> which have more semantic usually block so we can do not specify name for it   
      ! div: is no semantic box so we should always named classes if we want select them-->
      <!-- <section class="hero"> 
      * now we can choose this section-hero is container but if we do it we cant create fixed sized container like we want to

     * and the content in this a element is small text usually called MICRO COPY and we need to think about this small content when we design
    * now this button here is main call to action button of this page, and it's basically the action which we want the user do  when go to website
    * so in this case we want user subscribe to Onifood subscription right therefore we should write something related to that like: Subscribe now
     ! but since the goal of company is also want the user eat the heathy food so we can write: Start eating well, because it's little bit rude if we call signup, subscribe now in the first time right-->
