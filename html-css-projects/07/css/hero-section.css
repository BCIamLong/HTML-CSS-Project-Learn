         ******* NOTE ********
  !We should divide the structure of our files: GENERAL REUSE COMPONENT, HEADER, SECTIONS, FOOTER....
  = 01: usually we will set dimension for height cuz it's easy to control
  = 02: with the small value and we don't to change when scale layout we can use px instead use rem unit like border-radius: this value here might not change anymore
  = 03: keep add the new values to system size above because then when our CSS file grown we can easy to know all the values we use and create consistent
  !we should put grid, container reuse classes on top GENERAL STYLE cuz it might use the most on our page
  = 04  padding-bottom: 70%;
    ! remember that's in here 70% is the 70% of width parent element not height(only height property is % of height parent element)
    ! and it's even true despite you manipulate with padding-bottom
