/* *WE WILL WRITE THE MEDIA QUERIES IN THIS FILE */

/* 
  * to write media queries
  * First we need to define breakpoints which basically the width we want to set for media queries so to do that we need to check the website with many different size and define where is breakpoint
! one rem and em do NOT depend on html font-size in media queries, Instead 1rem = 1em = 16px(which is by default browser)
? the different between em and rem
* rem is the root font size
* em is the current font size
? so why we also need to use em? 
* because rem unit has some bugs in some browsers when used in media queries and therefore we should not use rem unit in media queries but em unit
* em is work exactly in the same like rem unit
  */

/* * so now we want set the first breakpoint is 1366px but we need to use em unit right so we will divide 16px
* 1366px/16px = 85.375 but we will use the round number: 85em => 85em = 1360px */

/* !FIRST BREAKPOINT: 1360px(85em) */
@media (max-width: 85em) {
  /* * now here we want decease the size of hero section to 1200px like the container we set for all section to create better look */
  .hero {
    /* * rem unit in here still use normal but we don't use it for media queries ok only use em */

  }

/* * so now we can see when we decrease the width to 1200px now so many element like text image in many section still big, it's not break our layout but it's not good to look and present 
* therefore we also need the media for this breakpoint 1200px: 75em*/

/* ! now in fact everything we're doing here only works because we already have the other three responsive web design ingredients already in place
* so we already have a fluid grid and responsive images(flexible image) and responsive unit, otherwise none of this would work at all */

@media (max-width: 75em) {
  /* * because we need to edit many elements like text, image, space down so it looks like general reset right 
 * therefore we can use the responsive unit which we set when we start code CSS files, that's rem unit 
 * everything length we did in every element is rem unit and rem unit we can set it in <html> element right 
 * therefore we can do it by edit the size of rem unit in <html>  */

    * so every single element will change
    * and this is big trick using technique
    * we only define 1 rem = how much to suite with our layout right, so it's very great we only do it in one step
    * so now we will try 9px => 9px/16px = 56.25% */

  ! some element is still big and look not good therefore we will change it to small by write code here but not too much */
